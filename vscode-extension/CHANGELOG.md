# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Integrated Power are recorded here.

## [0.7.0] - Unreleased

Planned as the first Open VSX public release.

### Changed

- Adopted the Integrated Power product and publisher display name.
- Renamed the user-facing orchestration component to Integrated Orchestrator
  while retaining `eggr-orchestrator` as its compatibility identifier.
- Clarified that Open VSX is a distribution channel and Antigravity IDE on
  Windows 11 is the initial supported runtime.
- Added public licensing, commercial licensing, security, privacy and support
  boundaries.

### Security

- On Windows, the Dashboard continues to read the signed-in user's local Agy
  credential in a local process and query the usage API.
- Actual Agy access-token and refresh-token values are not written to Integrated
  Power settings, logs or the public repository.
- Users may also inspect Agy usage directly with the official TUI `/usage`
  command.
- Public packages contain no user Knowledge data, conversations, credentials,
  private remotes, developer paths or operational records.
- Integrated Power does not create, append to or replace `GEMINI.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-27

Internal Windows 11 stabilization release.

### Added

- A safe Configuration Center for Dashboard, Orchestrator and user-owned
  Private Git Knowledge, with independent setup and installation lifecycles.
- Hardware-aware local LLM candidate selection using VRAM, Compute Capability,
  backend constraints, installed model evidence and user override policy.
- Orchestrator installation planning, ownership checks, backup, atomic
  activation, rollback and idempotent reinstall behavior.

### Changed

- Restricted plugin discovery and migration to known Antigravity IDE plugin
  roots instead of searching user directories recursively.
- Preserved `eggr-orchestrator` and `eggr-orchestrator-plugin` as machine
  identifiers.

### Security

- Blocked replacement of unrecognized same-name plugin directories.
- Removed `GEMINI.md` creation and replacement from the extension lifecycle.
- Kept developer Knowledge, credentials, user paths and private remotes out of
  distributable artifacts.
