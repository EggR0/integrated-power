# Changelog

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Changed the managed Antigravity IDE plugin and skill identity to
  `ip-orchestrator-plugin` and `ip-orchestrator`.
- Added exact-path, non-destructive migration from recognized
  `eggr-orchestrator` and `codex-orchestrator` installations.
- Moved the default product state root to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntegratedPower\state`; legacy state is copied once without
  deleting the old directory.
- Made Configuration Center environment refresh re-read the live Windows
  user/system PATH and standard CLI install locations, so newly installed
  GitHub CLI can be detected without restarting the IDE.
- Added GitHub login/remote detection and an explicit Knowledge `origin`
  reconfiguration action.
- Clarified which dependencies are optional and separated the non-mutating
  Knowledge setup wizard from automatic `save-agent-worklog` synchronization.
- Expanded the Configuration Center and README explanations of why Dashboard,
  Integrated Orchestrator, and Private Git Knowledge are separate.

All notable user-facing changes to Integrated Power are recorded here.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Adopted `EggR` as the publisher and `EggR.integrated-power` as the extension
  identity.
- Moved the public repository to `EggR0/integrated-power`.
- Removed release numbers and review-state wording from the packaged README so
  routine GitHub documentation changes do not become stale marketplace text.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Adopted `integratedpower.integrated-power` as the canonical extension ID
  before the first marketplace publication.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-28

Planned as the first Open VSX public release.

### Changed

- Adopted the Integrated Power product and publisher display name.
- Renamed the user-facing orchestration component to Integrated Orchestrator
  while retaining `eggr-orchestrator` as its compatibility identifier.
- Clarified that Open VSX is a distribution channel and Antigravity IDE on
  Windows 11 is the initial supported runtime.
- Added public licensing, commercial licensing, security, privacy and support
  boundaries.

### Security

- On Windows, the Dashboard continues to read the signed-in user's local Agy
  credential in a local process and query the usage API.
- Actual Agy access-token and refresh-token values are not written to Integrated
  Power settings, logs or the public repository.
- Users may also inspect Agy usage directly with the official TUI `/usage`
  command.
- Public packages contain no user Knowledge data, conversations, credentials,
  private remotes, developer paths or operational records.
- Integrated Power does not create, append to or replace `GEMINI.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-27

Internal Windows 11 stabilization release.

### Added

- A safe Configuration Center for Dashboard, Orchestrator and user-owned
  Private Git Knowledge, with independent setup and installation lifecycles.
- Hardware-aware local LLM candidate selection using VRAM, Compute Capability,
  backend constraints, installed model evidence and user override policy.
- Orchestrator installation planning, ownership checks, backup, atomic
  activation, rollback and idempotent reinstall behavior.

### Changed

- Restricted plugin discovery and migration to known Antigravity IDE plugin
  roots instead of searching user directories recursively.
- Preserved `eggr-orchestrator` and `eggr-orchestrator-plugin` as machine
  identifiers.

### Security

- Blocked replacement of unrecognized same-name plugin directories.
- Removed `GEMINI.md` creation and replacement from the extension lifecycle.
- Kept developer Knowledge, credentials, user paths and private remotes out of
  distributable artifacts.
